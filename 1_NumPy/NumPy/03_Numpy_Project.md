# Data Generator

develop a data generation application using only the NumPy library in Python. The objective is to create a CSV file containing synthetic product data, including product IDs, titles, and prices. By utilizing NumPy, we will achieve data generation and manipulation without relying on external libraries. This project will demonstrate how NumPy can be employed for data simulation and storage.

- ID Column: The ID column will include values from 1 to 100, representing unique identifiers for each product.
- Product Title Column: For each row, the Product Title column will randomly select one product title from the set: "brot", "kaese", or "honig".
- Price Column: The Price column will be populated with randomly generated float values between 1 and 5, simulating product prices.



CSV Output: The generated data will be saved in a CSV file named product_data.csv, allowing easy sharing and import into other applications.
